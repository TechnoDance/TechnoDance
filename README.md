- Hi, I’m Techno, call me Tech, Techy, or J
- I’m most interested in penetration testing and coding. 
- I’m currently learning Rust.
- I’m proficient in Java, Python, and C++, but am not too interested in any collaberations or starting any Repos any time soon.
- Reach me at TheOne2104@protonmail.com or hit me up on Discord at #9306. I respond quicker to Discord but please keep any formalities to Email.
- If you need help I can always do my best to help you out in any way possible, I'm here to learn, further my skills, and help other people do the same. The net is a free place and let's keep it that way and let's all stay informed and feed our technolust.
